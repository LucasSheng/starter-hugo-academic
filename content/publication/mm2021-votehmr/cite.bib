abstract = {3D human mesh recovery from point clouds is essential for various tasks, including
AR/VR and human behavior understanding. Previous works in this field either require
high-quality 3D human scans or sequential point clouds, which cannot be easily applied
to low-quality 3D scans captured by consumer-level depth sensors. In this paper, we
make the first attempt to reconstruct reliable 3D human shapes from single-frame partial
point clouds. To achieve this, we propose an end-to-end learnable method, named VoteHMR.
The core of VoteHMR is a novel occlusion-aware voting network that can first reliably
produce visible joint-level features from the input partial point clouds, and then
complete the joint-level features through the kinematic tree of the human skeleton.
Compared with holistic features used by previous works, the joint-level features can
not only effectively encode the human geometry information but also be robust to noisy
inputs with self-occlusions and missing areas. By exploiting the rich complementary
clues from the joint-level features and global features from the input point clouds,
the proposed method encourages reliable and disentangled parameter predictions for
statistical 3D human models, such as SMPL. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performances on two large-scale datasets, namely SURREAL and DFAUST. Furthermore,
VoteHMR also demonstrates superior generalization ability on real-world datasets,
such as Berkeley MHAD.},
