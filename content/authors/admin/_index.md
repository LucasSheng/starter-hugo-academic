Dr. Lu Sheng is an Associate Professor (since 2019) at the [College of Software in Beihang University (BUAA)](http://soft.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher (2017-2019) in [MMLab@CUHK](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), with [Prof. Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/). 

Lu Sheng received his Ph.D. (2011-2016) at the [Department of Electronic Engineering](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/) in [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), advised by [Prof. King Ngi Ngan](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~knngan/). He also has an internship (2015-2016) in [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), with [Prof. Jianfei Cai](https://jianfei-cai.github.io/).

{{< icon name="university" pack="fas" >}} His research interests include computer vision, machine learning and multimedia, aiming at endowing machines with the capability to perceive, understand, reconstruct, and interact with the 3D visual world, with the following focuses recently:

- Data-driven models for extracting hierarchical 3D semantics, inferring semantical/geometrical relationships, and rendering high-fidelity 2D/3D contents, based on multi-modal signals (including 2D/3D vision, language, *etc*) and beyond.

{{< icon name="search" pack="fas" >}} **Lu Sheng** refers to **盛律** [(How to pronounce it?)](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en%26tab=TT#zh-CN/zh-CN/%E7%9B%9B%E5%BE%8B) in Chinese characters, while **律** may also be rendered as **Lü**, **Lv** or **Lyu** in English in different circumstances.
